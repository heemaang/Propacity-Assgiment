## 🧠 About the Project

The task involved recreating a reference landing page shared by the Propacity team. The goal was to match the layout, styling, and responsiveness as closely as possible.

- ✅ Fully responsive layout across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- ✅ Built with React.js using functional components and hooks
- ✅ Clean and modular component-based structure
- ✅ Image placeholder used in place of the reference background video (as the video was not publicly accessible)
- ✅ Smooth UI transitions and consistent design aesthetics

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** (with functional components)
- **CSS3** (standard styling)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Vercel** for deployment
- **Git + GitHub** for version control
